## Proposed Project Components
* Have control of cursor
* Have control of built-in camera
* Functional GUI
* GUI collects data
* Game logic

#### Cursor Control:
Be able to move cursor around screen by programming.
Be able to save location information of cursor.

#### Control Camera:
Be able to access built-in camera.
Save and store images.

#### GUI:
Create a GUI that generates any number of quadrants.
When quadrant is clicked, stores quadrant location, cursor location, and saves camera image.

#### Game Logic:
Create a matching game that creates a randomized board for each game. Create a scoring system.
Correct matches remain visible. Incorrect matches get "flipped" back over.

#### Data Collection:
Create a dataset of information from GUI.
Collect facial images at as many potential angles as possible.

#### Eye Gaze & Cursor:
Combine facial estimation, eye gaze estimation, and cursor control.
